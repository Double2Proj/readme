Features
	BoarBot has many other features besides simply claiming a boar every day. You can read a bit more about them here.

	Powerup Events
		An event that happens in all servers that occurs roughly once every 2 hours that rewards the user with a powerup if they complete a simple challenge. 
	Blessings
		This stat determines how likely you are to get rarer boars and more boars when a player collects their daily boar(s). Currently, this stat can be obtained from 4 places. You get blessings equal to your streak, up to 250. You get blessings for each unique, non-special boar you have, with all boars collected giving 250. (This is calculated by dividing how many unique boars you have currently by how many there are in total.) And you can get blessings by completing the weekly quests. If you complete all of a weeks quests, you will get 750 blessings. This resets at the end of the week. The last source is miracle charms. More on that in the next section. The formula is for the chances to get different boars is quite complex, however you can view it here:
Generally, blessings will become less impactful the more you get. The other section of blessings is currently not implemented, are impossible to obtain.
	Powerups
		Powerups are the main ways that a player can influence what boars they have and what boars they get. They are mainly obtained from powerup events and the weekly quests.
	Charms
		The last source of blessings are Miracle Charms. These massively boost your blessings, but are temporary and will disappear after you use your daily boar once after you activate them. They will boost your blessings amount by 10% compounding, but will cap at 1000 blessings per miracle charm. These are the only way to get very large blessing counts.
	Clones
		Clones will allow a player to duplicate a boar they already have. The rarer the boar, the more clones it takes!
	Gifts
		Gifts can be sent in a server and are opened by a player in that server. The fastest player to open the gift wins! There are some measures in place to help players with higher ping, however these gifts may favor players with certain pings. They can be sent either in the powerups menu, or by using the /boar gift command. You can get powerups, boars and boar bucks from these gifts. If you're lucky, you may even get a special item...
	Transmutation Charges
		Transmutation Charges allows a user to upgrade their boar to a random boar of a higher rarity. The higher the rarity, the more charges you need. These are the most elusive powerups, and can only be obtained by quests, gifts, or given on special occasions. You can have 30 of these at once. Any more would break the laws of thermodynamics.
	Hunts
		BoarBot originates from a discord server created for the purpose of solving hunts in the game Hypixel Skyblock. Because of this, BoarBot will semi-regularly have scheduled arg-like hunts for in game rewards.

Other Commands
	Along with the main commands listed above, BoarBot has a few more minor commands that aren't used often or aren't very important.

	Help
		Details all the different features in Boarbot. If you're looking for more information, this is the place to go!
	Boar-manage setup
		Using this command allows a server admin to set up BoarBot to allows it's usage in the server.
	Gift
		A faster alternative to sending a gift in the powerup menu.
	Guess
		This is where the answers to hunts are inputted.
	Report
		Used to report bugs you may find in BoarBot. 
	Support
		Links to the BoarBot patreon. Subscribing to the Patreon does not give any useable in game rewards, and only gives a badge. BoarBot will never be pay to win.
	Self-Wipe
		Can be used to completely delete your data from BoarBot. Your User ID may still be stored if you have violated the community guidelines. This is done to prevent players from continuing to abuse community features by deleting their data.

Hmm, what this...?
	BoarBot contains many different super rare boars and badges that can be obtained in a number of seperate ways.
