# Features
BoarBot has many other features besides simply claiming a boar every day. You can read a bit more about them here.

### Powerup Events
An event that happens in all servers that occurs roughly once every 2 hours that rewards the user with a powerup if they complete a simple challenge. 

### Blessings
This stat determines how likely you are to get rarer boars and more boars when a player collects their daily boar(s). You can read more about the sources for these in using the /boar help command in the bot. The formula is for the chances to get different boars is quite complex, however you can view it <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/74inrkixxa">here.</a

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f90d45f6-2965-403f-8e09-989993923714" alt="blessings">

## Powerups
Powerups are the main ways that a player can influence what boars they have and what boars they get. They are mainly obtained from powerup events and the weekly quests.

### Charms
These massively boost your blessings, but are temporary and will disappear after you use your daily boar once after you activate them. They will boost your blessings amount by 10% compounding, but will cap at 1000 blessings per miracle charm. These are the only way to get very large blessing counts.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb71907b-8b94-41f4-9032-cb1ef19fc16a" alt="charms">

### Clones
Clones will allow a player to duplicate a boar they already have. The rarer the boar, the more clones it takes!

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8f5483-de55-482e-93c3-30c3dbe50d4b" alt="clones">

### Gifts
Gifts can be sent in a server and are opened by a player in that server. The fastest player to open the gift wins! There are some measures in place to help players with higher ping, however these gifts may favor players with certain pings. They can be sent either in the powerups menu, or by using the /boar gift command. You can get powerups, boars and boar bucks from these gifts. If you're lucky, you may even get a special item...

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ebe158f-59da-4544-a930-7d959b56f8a2" alt="gift">

### Transmutation Charges
Transmutation Charges allows a user to upgrade their boar to a random boar of a higher rarity. The higher the rarity, the more charges you need. These are the most elusive powerups, and can only be obtained by quests, gifts, or given on special occasions. You can have 30 of these at once. Any more would break the laws of thermodynamics.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797c9025-1913-41fd-bae2-619a53674a38" alt="trans">

### Hunts
BoarBot originates from a discord server created for the purpose of solving hunts in the game Hypixel Skyblock. Because of this, BoarBot will semi-regularly have scheduled arg-like hunts for in game rewards.

# Other Commands
Along with the main commands listed above, BoarBot has a few more minor commands that aren't used often or aren't very important.
